Strategies for source gen and reflection should be defined once
for the model author. IOW, you should be able to say "NameHasSuffix".

Attributes:

This probably means that the attribute strategy is a list of 
type/attribute prop name pairs. 

This would be pretty ugly for reflection because things that are 
now Func would become reflection that might make assumptions. 

Better bet might be to use expressions and rip them apart for 
the source gen strategy. In this case, the strategy should probably 
be a (Type, Func<Attribute, T>) where T is an extract Expression. 
It should work for Bool, string and arity. 

This would change Attribute

String:
