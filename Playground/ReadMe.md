# Playground Readme

This project is a space for examples and testing ideas. At the moment it's a little messy and
not everything here works.

## Potential Patterns

This is the part of this PR that I'd like feedback on! :)

There are two somewhat orthogonal quetions: What should the Command model look like and what should Main look like. 

I anticipate that we will settle on a single model to "lead with". Thoughts on that are appreciated. What's more 
important is feedback on anything that seems a bad idea, a particularly good one, or what you'd really like to use. 

This is a WIP and currently it does not work correctly - the bug I just found is that binding doesn't work, but also
the parent argument appears also on the child, and the casing and prefixes are not correct (at least).
